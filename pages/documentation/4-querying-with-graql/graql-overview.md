Graql allows you to query a graph in a declarative, pattern matching fashion.

You can execute Graql in the [Graql Shell](graql-shell.html) or using [Java
Graql](../developing-with-java/java-graql.html).

## Query types

There are four types of queries, which are begun with the follow keywords:  
- [match](match-queries.html) - for matching patterns in the graph  
- [ask](ask-queries.html) - for querying if certain patterns exist in the graph  
- [insert](insert-queries.html) - for inserting types and instances  
- [delete](delete-queries.html) - for deleting types and instances    
- [compute](compute-queries.html) - for computing useful information about your graph
