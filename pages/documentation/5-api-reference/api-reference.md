Welcome to the API Reference landing page. From here, you can find the latest, and all previous, versions of our API reference, which are built from Javadocs.

## Versions
The latest version will always be posted at [https://grakn.ai/javadocs.html](https://grakn.ai/javadocs.html).   
You can use the drop down selector to choose previous versions of the API reference, should you want to refer back to them. 

{% include note.html content="Before Grakn v0.6.0, we used a different name (MindmapsDB); you can find API reference for versions of MindmapsDB from 0.1.0 - 0.5.0 [here](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.mindmaps/mindmaps-core/0.5.0)." %}

## Feedback
We hope you find our documentation helpful, but if you need more information, please don't hesitate to contact us using our [discussion forums](http://discuss.grakn.ai) or through our main [website](http://www.grakn.ai).
