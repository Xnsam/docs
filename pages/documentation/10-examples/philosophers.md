## Introduction

### Philosophers

The Grakn repo on Github contains [philosophers.gql](https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn/blob/master/grakn-dist/src/examples/philosophers.gql), which is used to illustrate the [basics of the object model](../the-basics/grakn-basics.html). You can also find the `philosophers.gql` file within the Grakn distribution zip and load it into a graph using the Graql shell, as discussed in the [Quick Start Tutorial](../the-basics/quickstart-tutorial.html), which explains the basics and illustrates how to make simple queries on the graph.

The [sample-projects](https://github.com/graknlabs/sample-projects) repo on Github contains a Java project that uses the Java Graph API. It is described in more detail in the [Graph API Overview documentation](../core-api/overview.html), which replicates the Quick Start tutorial using the Graph API.
