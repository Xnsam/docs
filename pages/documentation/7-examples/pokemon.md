## Introduction

The MindmapsDB repo on Github contains [pokemon.gql](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/mindmapsdb/blob/master/mindmaps-dist/src/examples/pokemon.gql), which is a simple example to illustrate the basics of MindmapsDB Graql statements and queries. You can also find the example within the MindmapsDB distribution zip.
