## Introduction

The Grakn repo on Github contains [pokemon.gql](https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn/blob/master/grakn-dist/src/examples/pokemon.gql), which is a simple example to illustrate the basics of Grakn Graql statements and queries. You can also find the example within the Grakn distribution zip.
