## Introduction

The MindmapsDB [sample-projects](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects) repo on Github contains [pokemon.gql](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects/blob/master/pokemon.gql), which is a simple example to illustrate the basics of MindmapsDB Graql statements and queries. You can also find the example within the MindmapsDB distribution zip.
