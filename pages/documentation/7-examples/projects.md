## Introduction

This page lists potential research projects that could be based upon MindmapsDB. We are always happy to discuss your ideas, either based on these suggestions or for other projects. Please see our [Community page](https://mindmaps.io/community.html) for ways to get in touch with us!

## Undergraduate Project Ideas

* Develop an application that shows how a graph database can excel over RDBMS for certain domains. For example, a game search engine that has features like search by: genre, ratings, price, keywords, etc. You could pick any area you are interested in (books, music, recipes - the list goes on); the main requirement is something with a lot of highly connected data. Once this project has been tried and tested, it may be interesting to abstract further and look at building a factory that creates the basic search engine, and can then be customised according to subject area and features.      

* Define a simple ontology, which is just a specification of the components of a system and how they relate, and then devise logical rules to construct a simple application. An example may be to produce a set of rules that can validate that a Sudoku puzzle has been filled correctly.

* Add a new feature to Moogi that allows users to “like” concepts. Then produce a visualisation that displays the link between the things that a user likes. For more information about Moogi, the film discovery engine that is built on MindmapsDB, please see https://moogi.co/.

* Write a review of Graph Database technologies with pros and cons and example apps.	

* Clean Moogi data and port it to Mindmaps. This requires dabbling a bit with Gremlin, scripting, exploring the graph and ETL probably.


## Postgraduate Project Ideas

* Using Machine Learning to work with the semantics of the graph.   	
* Semantic search engine for computer science publications. How do ranking results based on topology compare to user data? Can we use an ensemble measure to get “better” results?
