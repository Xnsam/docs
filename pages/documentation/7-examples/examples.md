## Introduction

This page lists the examples of Grakn that we suggest you study to learn how to work with our stack.  We plan to continue to expand our set, and we also encourage you to let us know if you have example code to share, so we can link to it (for example, to your repo or a blog post).

If you would like to request a particular example, please get in touch with us by leaving a comment on this page or posting a question on the discussion boards.  Our [Community page](https://grakn.ai/community.html) lists other ways you can talk to us.

### [Pokemon](./pokemon.html)

A [simple example](./pokemon.html) to illustrate the basics of Grakn Graql statements and queries. You can also find the example within the Grakn distribution zip.

### [Philosophers](./philosophers.html)

This is a [simple example](./philosophers.html) to illustrate the [basics of the object model](../the-basics/grakn-basics.html). You can also find the example within the Grakn distribution zip.


### [Moogi](./moogi.html)

[Moogi](https://moogi.co) is a large database of information about movies. We have provided some [documentation](./moogi.html) and a subset of the data for you to investigate.

### [Modern](./modern.html)

The [Modern example](./modern.html) is a simple one, designed to test your knowledge of Graql.

### [SQL Migration](./SQL-migration.html)

A common use-case is to migrate existing SQL data to a graph in Grakn. Please see the [SQL migration example](../examples/SQL-migration.html) for an example of how to use the migrator. We also cover SQL migration in a [blog post](https://blog.grakn.ai/populating-mindmapsdb-with-the-world-5b2445aee60c#).

### [OWL Migration](./OWL-migration.html)

For more information about migrating OWL to Grakn, please see the [OWL migration example](../examples/OWL-migration.html).

### Oncologists

The oncologists example walks through the basics of Grakn from a beginner's perspective. You can find the blog posts here:

### R and Python bindings
It is possible to extract data from Grakn and use it as a data science tool for analysis. You can take the results of a Graql query and store the results in a dataframe or similar structure, for use with R or Python. This [blog post](https://blog.grakn.ai/there-r-pandas-in-my-graph-b8b5f40a2f99#) explains and gives a simple example.
