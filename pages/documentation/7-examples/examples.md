## Introduction

This page lists the examples of MindmapsDB that we suggest you study to learn how to work with our stack.  We plan to continue to expand our set, and we also encourage you to let us know if you have example code to share, so we can link to it (for example, to your repo or a blog post).

If you would like to request a particular example, please get in touch with us by leaving a comment on this page or posting a question on the discussion boards.  Our [Community page](https://mindmaps.io/community.html) lists other ways you can talk to us.

### [Pokemon](./pokemon.html)

The MindmapsDB [sample-projects](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects) repo on Github contains [pokemon.gql](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects/blob/master/pokemon.gql), which is a [simple example](./pokemon.html) to illustrate the basics of MindmapsDB Graql statements and queries. You can also find the example within the MindmapsDB distribution zip.

### [Philosophers](./philosophers.html)

The MindmapsDB [sample-projects](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects) repo on Github contains [philosophers.gql](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/sample-projects/blob/master/philosophers.gql), which is a [simple example](./philosophers.html) to illustrate the [basics of the object model](../the-basics/mindmaps-basics.html). You can also find the example within the MindmapsDB distribution zip.


### [Moogi](./moogi.html)

[Moogi](https://moogi.co) is a large database of information about movies. We have provided some [documentation](./mini-moogi.html) and a subset of the data for you to investigate.

### [Modern](./modern.html)

The [Modern example](./modern.html) is a simple one, designed to test your knowledge of Graql.

### [SQL Migration](./SQL-migration.html)

A common use-case is to migrate existing SQL data to a MindmapsDB graph. Please see the [SQL migration example](../examples/SQL-migration.html) for an example of how to use the migrator.

### Oncologists

The oncologists example walks through the basics of MindmapsDB from a beginner's perspective. You can find the blog posts here:
