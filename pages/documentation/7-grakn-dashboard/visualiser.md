## Introduction
The Grakn visualiser provides a graphical tool to inspect and query your graph data. This article shows how to get it up and running on a basic example and introduces the visualiser's key features.

## Loading and Visualising a Graph
If you have not yet set up the Grakn environment, please see the [Setup guide](../get-started/setup-guide.html).

You can find the *basic-genealogy.gql* example that we will work with in the *examples* directory of the Grakn distribution zip. You can also find this file on [Github](https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn/blob/master/grakn-dist/src/examples/basic-genealogy.gql). 

The first step is to load the ontology and data into Grakn. You need to use your terminal to do this, as the visualiser is a read-only interface to a graph. From the terminal, start Grakn, and load the file as follows:

```bash
<relative-path-to-Grakn>/bin/grakn.sh start
<relative-path-to-Grakn>/bin/graql.sh -f ./examples/basic-genealogy.gql -k "family"
```

{% include note.html content="To illustrate the use of different keyspaces, will we use a keyspace called `family` in this example, but you can simply use the default keyspace if you prefer, if it is not already in use, by omitting the -k argument." %}

You can test in the Graql shell that all has loaded correctly. For example:

```bash
<relative-path-to-Grakn>/bin/graql.sh -k family
match $p isa person, has identifier $i;
```

Now open the visualiser by browsing to [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567). 

To visualise your graph, go to the keyspace selector on the top right and select the appropriate keyspace, e.g. `family`.

The main pane of your graph will be empty at this point. Click the Types dropdown in the top menu, then Entities and `person`. 
The query for your selection will be displayed in the form with a default limit of 100 results applied. In this case:

```graql
match $x isa person; offset 0; limit 100;
```

If you click and hold on any of the entities - a pop-up will open to allow you to select the labels shown on each node in the graph. In the screenshot below, we have selected to show the identifiers of each person.

To clear the graph, press Shift + the "Clear" button (the circle with the cross through it). 

You can also submit queries by typing them into the form, then pressing ">" to visualise the graph. You can zoom the display in and out, and move the nodes around for better visibility. For example:

```graql
match $x isa person, has firstname "John"; 
```

![John query](/images/john-query.png)

Note that the `offset 0; limit 100` values are applied automatically, but the default values can be changed.

## Working With The Visualiser

There are a number of horizontal tabs on the left hand side of the screen, described as follows.

### Graph
This is the main section of the visualiser that you will use to explore the graph. 

We have already shown an example of how to examine `person` entities using the entity selector. As another example, select "Types", followed by "Relations" and filter on `marriage` relations. The query will be shown in the query section at the top of the main pane, as previously, and the visualiser displays all the `marriage` relations in the graph. 

![Marriages query](/images/marriages.png)

A short video illustrates the process:

<br />

#### Analytics Queries
You will notice a 'pencil' icon (on the far left of the horizontal icon menu at the top of the screen) that can be used to build Graql analytics queries. The following video illustrates how to build a shortest path query:

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLuVwjPrhbc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br />

We will walk through what is shown in the video. 

The first step is to clear the graph, then choose two people from the genealogy dataset, to determine the shortest path between them. For example, use the following query, and enter it into the form in the visualiser:

```graql
match $x isa person has firstname "Susan" has surname "Dudley";
$y isa person has firstname "Barbara" has surname "Herchelroth";
```

1. Submit the query by pressing ">" to visualise the graph. Just the two people in question (Susan Dudley and Barbar Herchelroth) should be visible in the graph. 

2. Use the pencil button to open the Query builders menu. We will use the first item in the drop-down, which is "Shortest Path". Click the "Start" button, then click first one node in the graph, and then click the other node (thus connecting the two people). 

3. Submit the shortest path query, which you will see in the form at the top of the visualiser, but pressing ">". The graph will display the relations, and nodes, that connect the two by the shortest path. If you chose Susan Dudley and Barbara Herchelroth, you should discover that Barbara is the great-grandmother of Susanâ€™s husband.

#### Inference

There are also 3 settings that can be changed using the 'cog' button (on the far right hand side of the horizontal icon menu at the top of the screen):

* Activate inference - activates inference, per query.
* Materialise inference - persists the inference into the graph, per query.
* Materialise All: activate and persist all inference across the graph.


### Console
You can use this console to make queries instead of running a Graql shell in your terminal. You can run `match` and `compute` queries, but because the visualiser is read-only, you cannot make insertions.

### Config
Shows a view on the Grakn configuration file. 

### Documentation
This opens a separate tab in your browser and points it to the Grakn documentation portal. It may be how you ended up on this page!
