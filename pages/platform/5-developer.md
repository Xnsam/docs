MindmapsDB puts the power of a knowledge graph in the hands of every developer.

## What languages can I use to work with MindmapsDB?   

At present, you can use Java. We also have Graql, a knowledge-oriented query language, which is allows you to express complex questions in simple and short pattern matching statements.    

Graql is declarative and therefore it handles the optimisation of the graph traversals needed to retrieve information.

## How can I start developing with MindmapsDB?   

MindmapsDB is an open source project, which is available now on [Github](https://github.com/mindmapsdb/mindmapsdb). Our developer documentation provides a range of guides to getting started, and can be found at [mindmaps.io](https://mindmaps.io/pages/index.html).
