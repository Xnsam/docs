Grakn makes building intelligent systems for complex data easy.

## Semantic Search Engines

Technologies like Google's Knowledge Graph pioneered the semantic search experience on the web. With Grakn, you can build ground breaking semantic search tools for your organisation's corpus of information with dramatically less engineering effort.

## Automated Fraud Detection

When processing large sets of heterogeneous data, such as customer transaction information, it is critical that your infrastructure can handle the data complexity if you would like to identify anomalies in real-time. GRAKN.AI allows you to easily explore complex networks of datasets and perform logical reasoning to detect fraudulent patterns in your dataset before it causes any harm to your customers.

## Intelligent Chat Bots

As devices have become more intelligent, the way we interact with them evolved to natural language through conversation. GRAKN.AI is the ideal platform for developing chat bots because it is capable of interpreting complex and ambiguous questions by performing inference over your knowledge graph.

## Advanced Drug Discovery

The process of drug research, synthesis, testing, and approval is incredibly time intensive and costly. These workflows produce large volumes of heterogeneous and interconnected data that unfortunately sit in silos. GRAKN.AI allows the integration of these datasets into one intelligent knowledge graph. The identification of, and reasoning upon, implicit linkages that Grakn does across datasets, departments and workflow phases allows you to catapult your research years into the future.

## Dynamic Risk Analysis

Risk analytics orgnisations rely heavily on the data they can process and understand. However, time available for implementing the measures to comply with the regulations is in months and not years. GRAKN.AI is the backbone of large-scale risk analytics that makes integration of information sources simpler and provides data analytics immediately out of the box.

## Data Exploration Tools

When exploring a large set of heterogeneous data, it is critical that you have the right structure and semantic model in order to effectively understand your data. Grakn dramatically simplifies the data infrastructure required to navigate through layers of highly interconnected data.

## Content-based Recommendation Systems

Pandora, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB are popular examples of technologies that exploit the power of content-based recommendation systems. Grakn allows you to quickly build advanced recommendation systems for your business by seamlessly integrating a powerful query engine.

## Knowledge Management Systems

Wikipedia has shown us what a powerful knowledge management system has to offer to the world: an organised, contextualised and highly interconnected information resource reused across the web. Grakn offers organisations the ability to easily develop systems to transform their information into reusable knowledge.

## Real-time analytics Tools

Many companies use analytics, but only a few of them can act on their data immediately without going through days, weeks or even months of developing the system. Grakn integrates real-time analytics as an inherent feature of its query language, allowing you to analyse your data in place without engineering effort.
