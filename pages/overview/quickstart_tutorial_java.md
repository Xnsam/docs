# Java Quick Start Tutorial

This document will teach you how to use Java to load both an ontology and some data into a Mindmaps Graph. You can find the example ```philosophers.gql``` in the examples directory included in the mindmaps.zip.   
If you have not yet set up the Mindmaps environment, please see the Quick Set Up guide. LINK TO DO
If you want to get started using Graql rather than Java, please see the Java Quick Start tutorial. LINK TO DO

**TO DO: This doc will be a replica of the Graql doc, but use the Java API instead. It will be generated when the Graql doc is closer to complete.**
